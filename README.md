Exploring the use of E₈ Lie group structure as a symmetry-based initialization strategy for transformer architectures.
# E₈-Seeded Transformer Architecture

This project explores a novel conceptual framework: using the symmetrical structure of the E₈ Lie group as a seed for initializing or guiding Transformer-based AI models.

## 👁️ Idea Summary

Modern transformers begin with random weights. But what if we seeded them with geometry instead?

E₈ is a 248-dimensional Lie group with perfect symmetry and deep roots in physics. This project proposes that the structure of E₈ — particularly its 240 root vectors — could provide a meaningful initialization prior for transformer embeddings, attention heads, or layer organization.

The parallels are visual, structural, and possibly profound.
