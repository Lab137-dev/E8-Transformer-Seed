# NEXT STEPS â€“ E8-Transformer-Seed Project

This document outlines the next steps for turning the E8-Transformer-Seed concept into a working prototype.  
The goal is to create a testable version of an AI transformer initialized using the 248-dimensional E8 Lie group structure.  
This structured approach is intended to invite collaboration, exploration, and possibly empirical insight into a novel symmetry-driven architecture for machine learning.

## ðŸ§© Project Focus Areas

- **E8 Data Prep**  
  Extract and format the 240 root vectors from E8 for use in Python.

- **Dimensional Mapping**  
  Map E8 vectors into transformer embedding dimensions (e.g., 512, 768).

- **Toy Transformer**  
  Build a lightweight 2-layer transformer in PyTorch or JAX.

- **Embedding Strategy**  
  Initialize token embeddings or positional encodings using E8 vectors.

- **Training Test**  
  Run a basic NLP or logic task and compare E8 vs. random initialization.

- **Graphing Output**  
  Track training speed, loss, and accuracy curves visually.

- **Documentation**  
  Update README and provide technical summary with results.

- **Promotion**  
  Share progress on GitHub, Reddit, X, and forums to attract collaborators.

## ðŸ§  Notes for Collaborators

- No working code exists yet â€“ the project is in pre-implementation stage.  
- All contributions are welcome: Python, math, design, visualization, or validation.  
- Contact: Danny Morgan via GitHub (`Lab137-dev`) or X (`@spiderdan08`).  
- Goal: Make this framework visible and testable to inspire deeper research or adaptation.
